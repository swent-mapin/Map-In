# SwEnt M1 Team Grading Report

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.


## Blue Belt

You qualified for a Blue Belt ü•ãüîµ and got a final grade of 5.03/6 for M1. Excellent work! You're demonstrating advanced skills.

We looked at several aspects, grouped into five categories. Here is the breakdown of the points you earned:

| **Implementation (APK, CI, tests)** | 5.71 out of 6 | 40%        | [See Details](#implementation-apk-ci-tests) |
| **Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog** | 3.75 out of 6      | 20%        | [See Details](#sprint-backlog--product-backlog) |

| **Architecture**                | 4.5 out of 6 | 15%       | [See Details](#architecture)               |
| **Scrum process documents**     | 5.75 out of 6       | 10%        | [See Details](#scrum-process-documents)    |
| **Final Grade**                 | **5.03 out of 6**    |            |                                           |


In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

## Implementation (APK, CI, tests)

We looked at whether your APK is functional and reliable. We also assessed your repo setup, whether it is clearly organized and if there is a CI running Sonar Cloud and running tests including at least one meaningful end-to-end test.

Your APK demonstrates impressive functionality and reliability, with many features already implemented for M1, including complete end-to-end user flows. The profile customization is nicely executed, and the UI reflects great attention to detail. It runs smoothly in both light and dark modes, and overall, the app is remarkably stable; we couldn‚Äôt make it crash despite trying extensively.

Minor issues remain, such as input sanitization only allowing spaces and small visual bugs on the banner‚Äôs modify button and profile button. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include simple toggles or confirmation dialogs for unimplemented features or actions.

Sonar is correctly integrated into the repository, tests are successfully run through the CI, and there is at least one meaningful end-to-end test, with an impressive 90.1% line coverage on the M1 code. As a team, you have established clear branch and commit naming conventions, review guidelines, and a communication protocol for complex merges or conflicts through a dedicated Discord channel. The only thing missing is a standardized PR description format.

For this part, you received 5.71 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

Your Sprint and Product Backlogs show structure and effort, but there is still room for improvement in organization and tagging. You should introduce labels such as User Story, Sprint Task, Fix, or Chore to clearly distinguish the purpose of each issue. Parent‚Äìchild relationships should also be set, with each User Story linked to its corresponding Sprint Tasks, something Ziyad did correctly, but which the rest of the team needs to adopt. Each task has one assignee, which is good practice.
However, Sprint 1, 2, and 3 tags should be discontinued, and you should start including estimated time or dates for tasks. The Milestone and Size tags are also missing and should be added. On the positive side, acceptance criteria are clearly defined for your User Stories. Most of your work consists of User Stories, which may explain why some of your pull requests were quite large in recent sprints. To make progress smoother and avoid dependency issues, you should break them into smaller Sprint Tasks, for example, separating work into UI, domain, and ViewModel components.
Each User Story follows the correct template, and all have priorities set, although the size attribute is still missing. The backlog reflects a strong mid-term vision for the project, prioritizing important User Stories first. However, the number of User Stories remains low, and at your current pace, the backlog could be empty in less than three sprints. Maintaining a longer-term roadmap will help sustain steady development.

For this part, you received 3.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma

We evaluated your Figma, whether it is up-to-date with the app and how it is used as a communication, planning and design tool to accelerate the implementation of good UI.

The Figma design is clean and well structured, with an M1 sheet already created. It is mostly up to date with the current version of the app, although some elements, such as the ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù button and certain subscreens like the ping selection flow and heatmap, are missing. While the design closely matches the implementation, it tends to follow the APK rather than lead it, so anticipating the UI earlier in the development process would be beneficial. Aside from a few minor icon differences, the overall consistency between design and implementation is excellent. It would also be helpful to add a dedicated testing page that lists all test tags in one place for easier reference and coordination.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Architecture

We reviewed your project‚Äôs architecture diagram, whether it is up-to-date with the app and if it follows clean design principles. We also looked at how it is used to discuss and document the architecture of the app as the app evolves.

The architecture diagram is clear and provides a good overview of the app‚Äôs structure. You‚Äôve followed the Android App Architecture guide with three layers: UI, Domain, and Data. However, the diagram is not up to date with the app, as it doesn‚Äôt show the UserProfile data in the Data layer and the Profile screen in the UI layer.

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process Documents

We reviewed your Scrum process documentation, including Sprint Retrospectives and Team Standup. We assessed whether they documented the process in detail, and how they were used to prepare the meetings. We also looked at your ability to lead structured and effective meetings, with everyone's participation.

All scrum documents were fully completed before the meeting!

Meetings are well structured and the entire team has shown real engagement during the meetings. You have consistently delivered valuable demos that clearly showcase progress at the end of each sprint. While you have facilitated meetings effectively so far, we expect greater autonomy so we do not need to intervene, and a clearer separation of the three phases: sprint review, sprint retrospective, and sprint planning.

For this part, you received 5.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M1 is 5.03. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
