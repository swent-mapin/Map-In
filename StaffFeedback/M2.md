# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

Be careful with the heavy use of toasts to inform the user, as this is not good practice. Toasts should not be used in production and are meant mainly for debugging or partially implemented features. For example, validation errors in the login flow should appear directly under the corresponding input field rather than as a toast. Moving beyond this, there are also a few functional issues: after creating a new account, the message "user profile not found" appears; input fields during account creation are not sanitized; the direction indicated by the position is incorrect; and when requesting a route to an event, selecting another event and requesting the route again only clears the previous result instead of updating it on the first attempt.

That said, the app itself is very stable and does not crash. The overall experience is smooth, and at this stage most of the feedback is more about refinement than major issues. On the code side, there are some inconsistencies in team conventions, especially regarding documentation. Some files have a global KDoc header while others do not. Your MVVM architecture is well followed, and naming conventions are consistent, but file organization could be improved, particularly in the model directory, which feels a bit cluttered. Code duplication is minimal, which is great. 

However a lot SonarCloud issues remain open, including 21 high-priority items that should be addressed, along with 76 medium-priority ones that would be worth reducing even if not all are critical. Overall, the code quality is good and moving in the right direction, but you should resolve theses

Finally, your testing and CI setup are solid. You have good test coverage and two meaningful end-to-end tests. Sonar is well integrated into the project, and the pipeline functions smoothly.

Overall, very good job!

For this part, you received 5.22 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

A large number of features have been delivered, and your application already demonstrates real utility. It clearly meets, and even goes beyond, the expectations of an MVP. You make effective use of a sensor through GPS, rely on a public service with Firestore, integrate a map, and provide three different authentication flows. This is excellent work and fully deserves a 6 for this part. Keep it up!

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

The Figma screens are very clean, all named and organized according to clear user flows. Well done! The Figma file is also slightly ahead of the app, as it already displays friends’ locations on the map. However, the Edit Profile screen is not up to date and does not reflect the current APK.

The architecture diagram provides a precise and detailed overview of the app’s structure. You’ve followed the Android App Architecture guide with three layers: UI, Domain, and Data. However, the diagram is not easily readable and should instead present a higher-level view of the app. You should group related screens by responsibility to separate concerns, rather than listing them individually. Consider using color coding to distinguish the different blocks and make the diagram clearer.

For this part, you received 4.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

The Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog are well constructed, and you have many user stories ready for future work. They are clearly improved compared to M1. 

However, both the sprint backlog and the product backlog still lack consistency. Estimates or actual time are often missing, and some tasks use a tag to indicate the related user story while others use a label, which is the better approach. Maintaining a uniform method across all items would make the backlog much clearer and easier to follow.

Overall it’s good, but not very consistent.

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

All your Scrum documents were fully completed before the meeting. As a small suggestion, ensure that your team retrospective covers at least one aspect of each area: process (how you worked), results (the outcome of your work), and team spirit (how you felt while working).

Meetings consistently start on time, and both the SM and PO provide relevant input. You regularly deliver great demos that are valuable and clearly show your progress. As a team, you are already almost self-sufficient and manage sprint meetings well. However, make sure the PO mentions whether the sprint goal was achieved (right after the demo) before moving on to what each person did during the sprint. Aim to fully master the Scrum ceremonies process for M3 to achieve complete autonomy.

For this part, you received 5.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

Each sprint brought significant improvements, with a clear and consistent delivery of value. You have all contributed valuable PRs and implemented multiple features that clearly strengthened the app. The work you have put in during M2 has been impressive. Great job!

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.
