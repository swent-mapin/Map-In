# SwEnt M3 Team Grading Report

This M3 milestone is the culmination of your SwEnt journey, and it gives us the final opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you performed in the project. By now, you should be capable of demonstrating a solid command of the Scrum methodology and collaborative teamwork, and be able to deliver a high-quality application that is ready for real users.
This feedback report is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback that you received from your coaches during the weekly meetings, over email, on Discord, etc.

You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M3 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M3.md) document.
As mentioned before, the standards for M2 were elevated relative to M1, and this progression continued into M3: we now hold you to the highest professional standard in SwEnt.

## Completeness

We first evaluated the depth and complexity of the main epics in your app, along with their contribution to the app, the tangible value they provide to the user, and their alignment with the app’s goals.

We evaluated the extent to which your app meets the course requirements articulated at the start of the semester, and whether they are implemented effectively, they integrate seamlessly, and are indeed essential to the app.

We also looked at the robustness and completeness of the different features you implemented: are all the features finished and polished, are they secure and bug-free, and are they thoughtfully designed.

Regarding the EPICs and the overall depth of your application, the work is excellent and there is very little to criticize. The application includes a wide range of EPICs, such as creating and joining events, adding memories, making friends, chatting with friends, gamification through badges, and an AI assistant. Event creation is particularly well designed: it is feature-rich, easy to use, and supported by a variety of filters.

You make effective use of cloud services, a solid authentication system, and multiple device sensors, including GPS and fingerprint authentication. Offline mode works well overall, with a caching system and a clear indicator showing whether the app is online or offline.

The only minor issue observed was when attempting to join events while offline, which sometimes resulted in technical errors that were not properly handled. Aside from this, offline functionality and feature completeness are excellent.

Overall, the application offers a very rich set of features, most of which are well implemented. Everything one would expect from an application of this type is present. Well done.

For this part, you received 5.8/6.

## Functionality

In this context, we assessed your app's ability to handle unexpected inputs provided by clueless or malicious users (including spamming buttons, entering wrong inputs, stopping a process mid-way, etc.); we wanted to see that your app handles all edge cases gracefully, has comprehensive error handling, and includes robust mechanisms for maintaining stability under stress.

We then evaluated the performance and reliability of the final product, i.e., the APK: we wanted to see that your APK is stable and the UI responds quickly and has seamless navigation.

Next we looked into your implementation of user authentication and multi-user support: does the app correctly manage users, can users personalize their accounts, does the app support session persistence, are multi-user interactions well supported, can accounts be used on another device, and is account information preserved when switching devices.

Overall, the end-to-end core flow of the application is very good. That said, a few minor issues were identified. When creating an account and entering the application for the first time, an unclear error appears on the “Own Events” page. Fortunately, retrying resolves the issue and the error disappears.

For the voice assistant feature, the application never explicitly requests microphone access, requiring the user to grant permissions manually, which is not ideal. However, the error message explaining the lack of permissions is clear and helpful. Additionally, the main modal window moves too far upward when fully expanded and, on some devices, is partially covered by the camera, which negatively impacts usability.

There are also small technical issues in the event search filters. When manually searching for a location and selecting it, a technical error sometimes appears. Similarly, clicking “Join” or “Save” on an event can cause a brief visual glitch or page jump. Navigation animations can occasionally feel awkward, with flashes between pages or modal transitions that appear abrupt or inconsistent.

The AI assistant is currently not functional, as it responds with a message asking the user to try again later. This is likely due to an API issue. Given the large number of features already implemented and the fact that this is an additional, advanced feature, particularly for the bota, this issue is not a major concern.

Aside from these minor inconsistencies, the application is very stable, responsive, and does not experience critical crashes. Considering the high number of implemented features, encountering a few minor issues is understandable.

Data persistence and consistency work flawlessly: events, memories, and profile changes are always saved and remain available after logging out and logging back in. The application is also robust against unexpected or random user input, with proper input validation in most cases.

Collaborative features such as chat function correctly. Overall, the complexity and depth of the implemented features are excellent. You clearly went beyond the course requirements by implementing numerous advanced functionalities, including the AI system, which was demonstrated successfully during our last meeting. Well done.

For this part, you received 5.7/6.

## User Experience

For this part, we wanted to see how intuitive and user-friendly the app is for real users. Beyond having good usability, did you pay attention to streamlining the interactions, is it easy to figure out, can new users start making good use of the app quickly, are the interaction flows well thought out and refined.

Overall, the navigation and architectural information are very strong. The decision to centralize most interactions within a modal window is interesting and works well in many ways, as it avoids cluttering the interface and keeps the map at the core of the application. However, this choice also hides many features, which can make the experience less intuitive for first-time users.

In particular, there is no clear indication that users need to tap the profile picture to access the profile and other features. This can feel unintuitive, as users typically expect clicking on the profile picture to lead only to the profile page. Important sections such as Friends, Memories, and Settings are hidden behind this interaction, which makes them harder to discover. Overall, having a visible menu and a dedicated profile button (for example, in the top-right corner) might have improved discoverability.

That said, once users become familiar with the application, navigation is clear and efficient. Visual consistency is excellent, with only minor padding issues, notably around badges. Both dark and light themes work well, and the application is visually polished. The use of icons for events on the map is particularly effective and enhances the overall aesthetic. The messaging system works well and is visually appealing, contributing to a consistent user experience.

Regarding guidance and onboarding, the initial account creation flow, especially password creation, is very well done and clear. However, once users enter the application, there is very little explanation of how to use it. Adding contextual hints or a short onboarding flow on first use would have improved the experience. That said, because the overall structure is well designed, users are still able to understand the app relatively quickly.

From a UX perspective, the application is well polished and offers strong, original features. Centering the experience around the map is a good design choice, and key elements such as the search bar, map, profile access, and event creation are quickly accessible. The search bar in particular is very effective for quickly finding people or events.

One minor area for improvement is the event detail view. While it is possible to see who created an event, this information could be made more visible, for example, by displaying the creator’s profile picture or a more prominent button. Overall, these are small details, and the application is very well executed.

For this part, you received 5.4/6.

## Design and Maintainability

We evaluated whether your code is of high quality and employs best practices.
We expect the codebase to be polished, well documented, follow consistent conventions, be modular, and allow for easy modifications.
You should be able to employ advanced techniques by now, such as asynchronous functions (flows, coroutines), good resource management, and automated dependency injection (e.g., with Hilt).

We also assessed your overall app architecture and design, looking in particular at aspects surrounding robustness and scalability.
We looked at both the codebase and the documentation of the app (Wiki and architecture diagram), we expect your design to demonstrate thoughtful consideration for performance, maintainability, and future growth.

The project has good architecture and modularity. Overall, the packaging is clear, responsibilities are well separated. It would be better to place the navigation package under ui, as navigation belongs to the presentation layer and grouping it there would improve consistency. Some functions are still rather long, which can reduce readability.

Under the model layer, the ai package contains many files, which makes it harder to understand how the different components relate to each other. Several files also begin with the prefix Ai, which is redundant given that they are already inside the ai package. The package could benefit from clearer internal structure, for example, separating speech-to-text and text-to-speech services into their own subpackage and grouping related components more explicitly.

There are only two high-severity Sonar issues left, and it’s clear that significant progress has already been made in reducing them, which is great to see. Since these remaining issues involve high cognitive complexity, addressing them would still be beneficial for long-term maintainability and would make those parts of the code easier to work with in the future.

For this part, you received 4.85/6.

---

## QA (Testing)

The first aspect we looked at here was your test suite, in terms of both quality and the final line coverage.
We expect the testing to be rigorous and to cover all components and edge cases, and they should validate every significant user journey.
Your end-to-end tests should be detailed and include error-handling scenarios.
The tests should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
Finally, your test suite should demonstrate advanced techniques, mock data for performance testing, and automated regression tests.

The continuous integration pipeline runs on pull requests, ensuring that the project is automatically validated and that regressions are detected early.

Sonar is integrated into the repository, providing visibility into code quality issues and helping maintain a high standard of reliability.

Your tests are generally very strong and well written. They are clear, structured, and cover the core functionality effectively. However, a few edge cases are occasionally missing, such as catch blocks or specific failure scenarios that would improve overall robustness. This does not include the files related to the AI chat integration, which are understandably harder to test thoroughly.

For this part, you received 5.47/6.

## Documentation

We looked at your README and GitHub Wiki to evaluate the quality and completeness of your app’s documentation. We expect the README and Wiki to be thorough and achieve professional-level clarity and completeness.
They should provide detailed descriptions of the app's architecture, implementation of the features, the development setup and guidelines for contributing.

We also assessed your use of Figma and the architecture diagram for effective UI design, organization, and app structure planning.
By this stage, we expect your Figma and Architecture diagram to be complete and up-to-date. The Figma should be consistent with the UI and the Architecture diagram should be comprehensive.

Regarding the quality of the README and wiki, both are very clear and well put together. The README explains what the app does, outlines the different features, includes screenshots, and provides direct access to the architecture diagram. The setup instructions are also complete and easy to follow. The wiki is well structured with additional documentation.

Regarding the Figma, it is clean and well organized by user flow, and the UI is clear and structured. A minor setback is that the M3 version should include all user flows, but the sign in flow is missing even though M3 is meant to consolidate all of them. Aside from this, the new user flows are well organized and clearly named by responsibility.

The architecture diagram is now readable and shows a clear improvement compared to previous milestones, so well done. The only minor issue is that several arrows cross each other, making the flow a bit harder to follow. This is a small nitpick though, as the diagram is well done and logically grouped by components.

For inline documentation, classes and interfaces are consistently documented, and the KDoc provided throughout is thorough. There are some minor inconsistencies. For example, the dispatcher module under the model package has no documented files, but this is really a minority. Overall, the documentation quality is very strong. Well done!

For this part, you received 5.35/6.

## Autonomy

A primary goal of SwEnt is to teach you how to function autonomously as a team.
For this part of the evaluation, we assessed you team’s independence, spanning Sprint 6 to Sprint 10, based on the meetings with coaches, Sprint planning, and how you managed risk.
By this stage, coaches should no longer be necessary for the team to operate, i.e., you can organize yourselves, you don't need to be reminded about tasks, and you can conduct the Scrum ceremonies on your own.

As a team, you’ve consistently demonstrated strong autonomy during meetings and discussions, and you’ve followed the Scrum ceremony process correctly. This represents a clear improvement compared to earlier milestones. Your tone has remained constructive, respectful, and professional throughout.

One of your notable strengths is the initiative you show. You actively ask questions, whether on Discord or after meetings, and you consistently seek advice and opportunities to improve. This proactive attitude is a real asset. Well done!

For this part, you received 6/6.
