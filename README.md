# Map’In

## App Description

Map’In is a social map for students that brings events and memories together in one place.  
The core experience is simple:  

- **Create events** and share them with others  
- **Join events** organized by friends, associations, or the community  
- **Add memories** (media in general) once the event is over  
- **View everything on an interactive map**, combining past and upcoming activities  

This way, students can not only discover and attend events, but also relive them afterwards through a collaborative map.
